# INC-5000-Companies-Analysis-Dashboard
The Inc. 5000 is Inc. Magazineâ€™s annual list of the 5000 fastest growing private companies in the United States and for this project, I have analyzed this data set which contains a CSV table with 5000 records, one for each company, each record contains details on the company like the company name, industry, founding year, website, and location, as well as 2019 revenue, % growth, number of workers (year-over-year), and the number of years on the list.
I have used power query editor for cleaning the dataset and DAX functions in power BI for some calculations.
From the analysis, I found the answers to interesting questions like - 
1.The average revenue among companies on the list, Broken down by industry.
2.What are the top 5 industries with largest average growth rate%.
3.Which state has the most number of companies?
4.Count of companies which have been on the list for 5 or more years.
5.The most represented industry i.e the industry with more number of companies.
